Abstract： In regional geological survey and resource exploration, the method of gravity and magnetic exploration is a conventional application method. The rapid location of the field line or point number of gravity and magnetic exploration is an important link in the design and project approval of gravity and magnetic exploration project, which is a necessary unit based on the relevant design requirements of the project on the basis of collecting relevant geological data and reconnaissance. In this paper, we present a recursive method to quickly locate the point and line numbers of field gravity and magnetic exploration. This method is suitable for arbitrary lofting region. For the line direction and point direction, the arbitrary lofting angle can be selected. Meanwhile, the single line truncation lofting can be avoided in the complex region. This method has achieved good results in model testing and practical applications.
